CS336 Assignment 1 - Leaderboard Submission
===========================================

## Modifications

### 1. Weight Tying (Primary Optimization)

**What:** Shared parameters between input token embeddings and output projection layer.

**Implementation:**
- Instead of separate lm_head linear layer, use transposed embedding weights
- Custom initialization: std = 1/sqrt(d_model) for stability
- Optional embedding scaling: multiply embeddings by sqrt(d_model)

**Benefits:**
- Reduced parameters by 36.2%: 45.2M → 28.8M parameters
- Saves 16.4M parameters (entire output projection layer)
- Faster training due to fewer parameters to update
- Better memory efficiency
- Often improves performance on smaller models

- Chowdhery et al. (2022) "PaLM: Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways"

**Code:**
```python
# In forward pass:
if self.tie_weights:
    logits = torch.matmul(x, self.token_embeddings.weight.T)
else:
    logits = self.lm_head(x)
```

### 2. Larger Batch Size + Scaled Learning Rate

**What:** Increased batch size from 32 → 64 with proportionally scaled learning rate.

**Configuration:**
- Batch size: 64 (2× baseline)
- Learning rate: 4e-4 (scaled by √2 ≈ 1.33×)
- Rationale: Linear scaling rule from Goyal et al. (2017)

**Benefits:**
- More tokens per iteration → faster convergence
- Better gradient estimates → more stable training
- Improved GPU utilization on H100

### 3. Aggressive Learning Rate Schedule

**What:** Higher peak learning rate with faster warmup and cosine decay.

**Configuration:**
- Max LR: 4e-4 (vs 3e-4 baseline, +33%)
- Min LR: 4e-5 (10% of max)
- Warmup: 300 iterations (vs 400 baseline, -25%)
- Schedule: Cosine decay from max to min over full training

**Benefits:**
- Faster initial progress
- More exploration in parameter space
- Better final performance with proper decay

### 4. Mixed Precision Training (BFloat16)

**What:** Use bfloat16 instead of float32 for computation.

**Benefits:**
- 2× speedup on H100 with Tensor Cores
- Same memory usage, ~2× throughput
- Minimal accuracy impact (bfloat16 has same exponent range as fp32)
- H100 has native bfloat16 support
