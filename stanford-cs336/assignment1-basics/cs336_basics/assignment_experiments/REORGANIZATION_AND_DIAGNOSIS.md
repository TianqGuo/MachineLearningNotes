# Reorganization Complete + Performance Issue Diagnosed

## What Was Done

### 1. Reorganized Experiment Structure ✓

Moved learning rate experiment files into a dedicated subdirectory following the pattern of one folder per experiment type.

**Before**:
```
cs336_basics/assignment_experiments/
├── learning_rate_sweep.py
├── analyze_lr_sweep.py
└── LEARNING_RATE_GUIDE.md
```

**After**:
```
cs336_basics/assignment_experiments/
├── README.md                      # Updated main readme
├── __init__.py
│
└── lr_sweep/                      # Learning rate experiment
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── README.md                  # Experiment guide
    ├── learning_rate_sweep.py     # Main sweep runner
    ├── analyze_lr_sweep.py        # Analysis tool
    ├── diagnose_lr_sweep.py       # NEW: Diagnostic tool
    ├── LEARNING_RATE_GUIDE.md     # Detailed guide
    └── PERFORMANCE_ISSUE.md       # NEW: Performance diagnosis
```

### 2. Updated Commands

All commands now use the new module path:

**Old**:
```bash
uv run python -m cs336_basics.assignment_experiments.learning_rate_sweep
```

**New**:
```bash
uv run python -m cs336_basics.assignment_experiments.lr_sweep.learning_rate_sweep
```

### 3. Created New Tools

#### Diagnostic Tool (`diagnose_lr_sweep.py`)

Checks:
- GPU availability and status
- Current training progress
- Throughput (tokens/sec)
- Estimated completion time

**Usage**:
```bash
uv run python -m cs336_basics.assignment_experiments.lr_sweep.diagnose_lr_sweep
```

### 4. Diagnosed Performance Issue ⚠️

Ran diagnostic on current training and found **critical performance problem**.

## Performance Issue Summary

### Current Status

```
GPU: RTX 4090 Laptop GPU (16 GB)
CUDA: Available ✓

Progress: Only 2.5% complete after 5+ hours
Throughput: 400-500 tokens/sec  ❌ WAY TOO SLOW
Expected: 5,000-10,000 tokens/sec on RTX 4090

Time Impact:
- Current: 50-60 hours per experiment
- Expected: 30-40 minutes per experiment
- Slowdown: 100× slower than expected!
```

### Root Cause

Training is **10-20× slower than expected**. Possible causes:

1. **Torch compilation not working** - May not be compiling effectively
2. **TF32 not enabled** - Missing 2-3× speedup on Ampere GPUs
3. **Thermal throttling** - Laptop GPU may be overheating
4. **Data loading bottleneck** - Inefficient data transfer
5. **Mixed precision not used** - Training in full float32

### Impact

At current speed:
- **Single experiment**: 50-60 hours (instead of 40 minutes)
- **Full sweep (7 LRs)**: 350-400 hours (instead of 4 hours)
- **This is unacceptable** - sweep will take **2+ weeks**!

### Recommended Actions

**See `lr_sweep/PERFORMANCE_ISSUE.md` for detailed diagnosis and solutions.**

Quick fixes to try:

1. **Stop current sweep** (won't finish in reasonable time):
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep learning_rate_sweep
   kill <PID>
   ```

2. **Enable TF32** for 2-3× speedup:
   ```python
   # Add to run_experiment.py
   torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True
   torch.backends.cudnn.allow_tf32 = True
   ```

3. **Check thermal throttling**:
   ```bash
   watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
   ```

   If GPU temp >85°C and clock speeds dropping:
   - Improve cooling (laptop cooling pad)
   - Reduce ambient temperature
   - Consider desktop GPU or cloud GPU

4. **Use low-resource mode** as fallback:
   ```bash
   uv run python -m cs336_basics.assignment_experiments.lr_sweep.learning_rate_sweep \
       --low-resource
   ```

   This reduces training budget 8×, taking ~7 hours per LR instead of 50.

## Directory Structure Benefits

### Clear Organization

Each experiment type gets its own directory:

```
assignment_experiments/
├── lr_sweep/              # Learning rate tuning
├── [future] batch_size/   # Batch size tuning
├── [future] architecture/ # Architecture experiments
└── [future] data_mix/     # Data mixture experiments
```

### Self-Contained Experiments

Each experiment directory contains:
- Main experiment script(s)
- Analysis/diagnostic tools
- Documentation (README, guides)
- Experiment-specific utilities

### Easy to Navigate

Users can quickly find experiment code and documentation:
```bash
cd cs336_basics/assignment_experiments/lr_sweep
ls
# README.md              - Quick start
# LEARNING_RATE_GUIDE.md - Detailed guide
# PERFORMANCE_ISSUE.md   - Troubleshooting
# *.py                   - Scripts
```

### Scalable

Adding new experiments is straightforward:
1. Create new directory
2. Add experiment scripts
3. Add README and documentation
4. Update main assignment_experiments README

## Updated Documentation

### Main README (`assignment_experiments/README.md`)

- Lists all experiments
- Shows directory structure
- Provides common commands
- Includes troubleshooting

### LR Sweep README (`lr_sweep/README.md`)

- Quick start guide
- Expected runtime
- Model configuration
- Output files
- Deliverables checklist

### LR Sweep Guide (`lr_sweep/LEARNING_RATE_GUIDE.md`)

- Detailed reference
- Hyperparameter search strategy
- Expected outcomes
- Optimization tips
- Monitoring and troubleshooting

### Performance Issue Doc (`lr_sweep/PERFORMANCE_ISSUE.md`)

- Detailed diagnosis
- Root cause analysis
- Solutions and workarounds
- Expected results after fixes

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Fix Performance)

1. **Review `lr_sweep/PERFORMANCE_ISSUE.md`**
2. **Stop current slow sweep**
3. **Apply performance fixes** (enable TF32, check thermal throttling)
4. **Re-run sweep** with optimizations
5. **Monitor throughput** - should be >5000 tok/s

### Short-term (Complete Experiment)

1. **Run optimized sweep**
2. **Use `diagnose_lr_sweep.py`** to monitor progress
3. **Analyze results** with `analyze_lr_sweep.py`
4. **Document findings** in `cs336_basics/basics/EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`

### Long-term (Future Experiments)

1. **Create new experiment directories** following this pattern
2. **Reuse infrastructure** from `cs336_basics.basics`
3. **Document each experiment** thoroughly
