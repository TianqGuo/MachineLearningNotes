## Key Findings

### 1. Optimal Batch Size: 8

**Batch size 8 achieved the best validation loss (1.3199)** among all tested configurations, demonstrating the best generalization performance.

Key characteristics:
- Best validation performance: 1.3199
- Reasonable training time: 3.06 hours
- Good balance between convergence speed and model quality
- 3,301 gradient updates

### 2. Training Efficiency vs. Model Quality Trade-off

**Wall-clock time analysis:**
- Batch 1: 7.22 hrs (slowest, but good performance)
- Batch 8: 3.06 hrs (best performance, good speed)
- Batch 32: 2.11 hrs
- Batch 64: 1.67 hrs
- Batch 128: 1.43 hrs (fastest)
- Batch 256: 7.56 hrs (slowest due to compilation overhead)

**Observation:** Batch size 256 took much longer than expected (~7.56 hrs), likely due to:
- torch.compile() compilation overhead
- Memory allocation/deallocation patterns
- Potential suboptimal GPU utilization at very large batch sizes

### 3. Validation Loss Degradation with Larger Batches

Clear trend of **increasing validation loss** as batch size increases:

```
Batch 1:   1.3778 (excellent)
Batch 8:   1.3199 (best)
Batch 32:  1.3902 (good)
Batch 64:  1.4341 (moderate)
Batch 128: 1.4868 (degrading)
Batch 256: 1.5908 (poor)
```

This follows the well-known phenomenon where **larger batch sizes lead to worse generalization**, often attributed to:
- Sharper minima (less robust)
- Reduced gradient noise (less exploration)
- Fewer parameter updates for the same token budget

### 4. Gradient Updates Matter

Number of gradient updates (steps) shows strong correlation with performance:

```
Batch 1:   25,701 updates → Val Loss: 1.3778
Batch 8:   3,301 updates  → Val Loss: 1.3199
Batch 32:  901 updates    → Val Loss: 1.3902
Batch 64:  501 updates    → Val Loss: 1.4341
Batch 128: 251 updates    → Val Loss: 1.4868
Batch 256: 126 updates    → Val Loss: 1.5908
```

**Key insight:** More frequent parameter updates (smaller batches) generally lead to better model quality, even when processing the same total number of tokens.

### 5. Memory Constraint: Batch Size 512

The experiment with batch size 512 failed immediately with CUDA OOM:

```
Error: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 256.00 MiB.
GPU 0 has a total capacity of 15.99 GiB
28.49 GiB allocated by PyTorch
```

**Analysis:**
- Input tensor: [512, 256] = 131,072 tokens per batch
- Output logits: [10000, 512] = 5,120,000 elements
- With activations, gradients, and optimizer states, memory requirement exceeded 16 GiB

**Implications:**
- Maximum practical batch size for this model on 16GB GPU: 256
- To train with batch 512+, would need:
  - Gradient accumulation
  - Larger GPU (24GB or more)
  - Model parallelism
  - Mixed precision training (though may not be sufficient alone)

## Training Dynamics Observations

### Learning Rate Warmup Effect

All configurations used proportional warmup:
- Batch 1: 12,800 steps warmup (1% of total)
- Batch 8: 1,600 steps warmup
- Batch 32: 400 steps warmup
- Batch 64: 200 steps warmup
- Batch 128: 100 steps warmup
- Batch 256: 100 steps warmup

Smaller batches benefited from longer absolute warmup, allowing more gradual adaptation.

### Loss Convergence Patterns

Initial loss across all batches: ~9.25-9.26 (as expected for random initialization with vocab size 10K)

Final train vs. validation loss gaps:
- Batch 1: 1.235 vs 1.389 (gap: 0.154)
- Batch 8: 1.352 vs 1.320 (gap: -0.032) ← **slight overfit mitigation**
- Batch 32: 1.418 vs 1.392 (gap: -0.026)
- Batch 64: 1.431 vs 1.437 (gap: +0.006)
- Batch 128: 1.480 vs 1.501 (gap: +0.021)
- Batch 256: 1.590 vs 1.596 (gap: +0.006)

Larger batches show less overfitting (train/val gap closer to 0), but at the cost of worse overall performance.

## Recommendations

### For Best Model Quality
**Use batch size 8** (or possibly 4-16 range):
- Achieves best validation loss
- Reasonable training time
- Good balance of convergence speed and generalization

### For Fastest Training
**Use batch size 128**:
- Fastest wall-clock time (1.43 hrs)
- Acceptable validation loss (1.49) if speed is critical
- 251 gradient updates sufficient for this token budget

### For Production Experiments
**Consider batch size 32-64**:
- Good compromise between speed and quality
- Batch 32: 2.11 hrs, val loss 1.39
- Batch 64: 1.67 hrs, val loss 1.43
- More stable training than very small batches

### For Large-Scale Training
If training with batch size > 256:
- Implement gradient accumulation (effective_batch_size = batch_size × accumulation_steps)
- Use mixed precision training (FP16/BF16)
- Consider larger GPU or multi-GPU training
- May need learning rate scaling with batch size

## Technical Notes

### Why Batch 256 Was Slower?

Despite having fewer steps (126), batch 256 took 7.56 hours (similar to batch 1's 7.22 hours):

Possible explanations:
1. **torch.compile() overhead**: First few iterations include JIT compilation
2. **GPU memory thrashing**: Operating near memory limits
3. **Suboptimal kernel launches**: Very large batches may not fully utilize GPU
4. **Memory fragmentation**: As noted in error message for batch 512

### Batch 512 OOM Analysis

Memory breakdown (estimated):
- Model parameters: ~91 MB (22.7M params × 4 bytes)
- Activations (forward): ~2-3 GB (depends on implementation)
- Gradients: ~91 MB
- Optimizer states (Adam): ~273 MB (2× parameters)
- Batch data: [512, 256] × 4 bytes = ~524 KB (negligible)
- Output logits: [512, 256, 10000] × 4 bytes = ~5.2 GB

**Total estimated:** ~8-9 GB base + activation memory

With PyTorch's memory allocator overhead and fragmentation, 16 GB was insufficient.

## Conclusion

This batch size sweep demonstrates the classic trade-off in deep learning:
- **Smaller batches** → More updates → Better generalization → Longer training
- **Larger batches** → Fewer updates → Faster training → Worse generalization → Higher memory

For this 22.7M parameter transformer on TinyStories:
- **Optimal quality:** Batch size 8 (val loss: 1.32)
- **Optimal efficiency:** Batch size 128 (1.43 hrs, val loss: 1.49)
- **Memory limit:** Batch size 256 max on 16GB GPU

The results strongly support the use of **moderate batch sizes (8-64)** for this model scale, trading some training speed for significantly better model performance.
