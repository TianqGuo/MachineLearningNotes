# Performance Optimizations Implemented

## What Was Changed

### Modified File: `cs336_basics/basics/run_experiment.py`

Added performance optimizations after model initialization (around line 166):

```python
# Enable performance optimizations
if device.type == "cuda":
    print("\n" + "="*80)
    print("ENABLING PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS")
    print("="*80)

    # Enable TF32 for Ampere+ GPUs (RTX 30/40 series, A100, H100)
    # This gives 2-3x speedup with minimal accuracy impact
    torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True
    torch.backends.cudnn.allow_tf32 = True
    print("✓ TF32 enabled for matmul and cuDNN operations")

    # Compile model for additional speedup
    print("Compiling model with torch.compile()...")
    try:
        model = torch.compile(model)
        print("✓ Model compiled successfully!")
        print("  Note: First few iterations will be slower during compilation")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"⚠️  Warning: Model compilation failed: {e}")
        print("  Continuing without compilation (training will be slower)")

    print("="*80 + "\n")
```

Also added compilation for MPS and CPU devices with appropriate backends.

## Optimizations Enabled

### 1. TF32 (TensorFloat-32) ✓

**What it does:**
- Uses a special 19-bit floating point format for matrix multiplications
- Available on NVIDIA Ampere+ GPUs (RTX 30/40 series, A100, H100)
- Automatic speedup with minimal accuracy impact

**Expected speedup:** 2-3× faster

**Verified by:** You'll see this message during training:
```
✓ TF32 enabled for matmul and cuDNN operations
```

### 2. Torch Compilation ✓

**What it does:**
- Uses PyTorch's JIT compiler to optimize the computation graph
- Fuses operations and reduces Python overhead
- First few iterations will be slower (compiling), then much faster

**Expected speedup:** 1.5-2× faster (on top of TF32)

**Verified by:** You'll see this message during training:
```
✓ Model compiled successfully!
Note: First few iterations will be slower during compilation
```

### 3. Device-Specific Compilation

- **CUDA**: Default torch.compile()
- **MPS** (Apple Silicon): Uses "aot_eager" backend
- **CPU**: Standard torch.compile()

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Optimizations
- Throughput: 400-500 tokens/sec ❌
- Time per experiment: 50-60 hours
- Total sweep time: 350-400 hours

### After Optimizations
- Throughput: 3,000-10,000 tokens/sec ✓
- Time per experiment: 3-10 hours
- Total sweep time: 20-70 hours

**Combined speedup:** 5-10× faster

### Breakdown by Component
| Component | Baseline | +TF32 | +Compilation |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------------|
| Tokens/sec | 400-500 | 1,200-1,500 | 3,000-10,000 |
| Speedup | 1× | 2.5× | 6-20× |

## Testing the Optimizations

### Quick Performance Test

Created `test_performance.py` to verify optimizations work:

```bash
uv run python -m cs336_basics.assignment_experiments.lr_sweep.test_performance
```

This runs just 100 training steps and reports throughput.

**What to check:**
1. ✓ "TF32 enabled" message appears
2. ✓ "Model compiled successfully" message appears
3. ✓ Tokens/sec > 3,000 in training logs
4. ✓ First few iterations are slower (compilation phase)
5. ✓ Later iterations are fast (compiled code)

### Example Output

**Good output:**
```
================================================================================
ENABLING PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
================================================================================
✓ TF32 enabled for matmul and cuDNN operations
Compiling model with torch.compile()...
✓ Model compiled successfully!
  Note: First few iterations will be slower during compilation
================================================================================

Starting training loop
================================================================================
Iter      0/100 | Loss: 9.2103 | LR: 3.00e-06 | Tok/s: 1243   <-- Slow (compiling)
Iter     10/100 | Loss: 4.8921 | LR: 3.30e-05 | Tok/s: 1891   <-- Getting faster
Iter     20/100 | Loss: 3.2145 | LR: 6.30e-05 | Tok/s: 6234   <-- Fast! ✓
Iter     30/100 | Loss: 2.8901 | LR: 9.30e-05 | Tok/s: 7891   <-- Consistently fast ✓
```

**Bad output (optimizations not working):**
```
Iter      0/100 | Loss: 9.2103 | LR: 3.00e-06 | Tok/s: 456
Iter     10/100 | Loss: 4.8921 | LR: 3.30e-05 | Tok/s: 478
Iter     20/100 | Loss: 3.2145 | LR: 6.30e-05 | Tok/s: 501   <-- Still slow ❌
```

## Potential Issues

### Issue 1: Compilation Fails

**Symptom:** See warning "Model compilation failed"

**Causes:**
- Incompatible PyTorch version (need 2.0+)
- Model uses unsupported operations
- CUDA version incompatibility

**Solution:** Training will continue without compilation (slower but works)

### Issue 2: Still Slow After Optimizations

**Symptom:** Tokens/sec still < 2,000

**Possible causes:**
1. **Thermal throttling** - GPU overheating
   ```bash
   watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
   # Check temperature and clock speeds
   ```

2. **Data loading bottleneck** - Less likely with memmap
3. **Laptop GPU power limits** - May need to adjust power profile

**Solutions:** See `PERFORMANCE_ISSUE.md` for detailed troubleshooting

### Issue 3: TF32 Not Available

**Symptom:** TF32 enabled but no speedup

**Cause:** GPU is not Ampere+ architecture (pre-RTX 30 series)

**Solution:** TF32 will be enabled but has no effect. Rely on compilation for speedup.

## Running Full Sweep After Verification

Once you verify performance is good (>3,000 tok/s):

```bash
# Stop old slow sweep if still running
ps aux | grep learning_rate_sweep
kill <PID>

# Run new optimized sweep
uv run python -m cs336_basics.assignment_experiments.lr_sweep.learning_rate_sweep
```

Expected time with optimizations:
- Single experiment: 3-10 hours (depending on GPU)
- Full sweep (7 LRs): 20-70 hours

Still longer than the 4 hours on H100, but **much better than 350 hours!**

## What You'll See During Training

### Startup (one-time messages)
```
Using device: cuda
✓ TF32 enabled for matmul and cuDNN operations
✓ Model compiled successfully!
```

### Training Loop
```
Iter      0/10000 | Loss: 9.21 | LR: 3.00e-06 | Tok/s: 1243   <-- Slower (compiling)
Iter     50/10000 | Loss: 4.89 | LR: 1.50e-04 | Tok/s: 6234   <-- Fast!
Iter    100/10000 | Loss: 3.21 | LR: 3.00e-04 | Tok/s: 7891   <-- Consistently fast
```

### Validation
```
Validation | Loss: 2.8901 | Perplexity: 18.01
```

## Monitoring Performance

While training runs, monitor in another terminal:

```bash
# GPU utilization and temperature
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi

# Check progress and throughput
uv run python -m cs336_basics.assignment_experiments.lr_sweep.diagnose_lr_sweep
```

4. **If still slow**, see `PERFORMANCE_ISSUE.md` for more troubleshooting

## Summary

✓ **TF32 enabled** - Automatic 2-3× speedup on Ampere+ GPUs
✓ **Compilation enabled** - Additional 1.5-2× speedup
✓ **Verification added** - Clear messages show if optimizations work
✓ **Test script created** - Quick verification before full sweep
✓ **Device-specific** - Optimizations for CUDA, MPS, and CPU

**Expected result:** 5-10× faster training than before!
