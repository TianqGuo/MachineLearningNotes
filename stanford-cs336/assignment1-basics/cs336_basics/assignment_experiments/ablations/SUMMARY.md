# Ablation Experiments - Summary

## Quick Results

All 5 ablation experiments completed successfully on TinyStories dataset (328M tokens, 22.7M parameter model).

### Performance Comparison

| Ablation | Validation Loss | Δ vs Baseline | Status |
|----------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| **Baseline** (pre-norm, RMSNorm, SwiGLU, RoPE) | **1.3902** | **0.00%** | ✓ |
| Post-norm | 1.3897 | -0.03% | ✓ (slightly better) |
| No Position Embeddings (NoPE) | 1.3902 | +0.00% | ✓ (identical) |
| No Layer Norm | 1.3985 | +0.60% | ✓ (minor degradation) |
| SiLU FFN (no gating) | 1.4101 | +1.43% | ✓ (clear degradation) |

## Key Findings

### 1. SwiGLU vs SiLU (Problem: swiglu_ablation)
- **Degradation: +1.43%** when removing gating
- **Conclusion:** Gating mechanism provides clear benefit
- **Recommendation:** Use SwiGLU in production systems

### 2. Layer Norm (Problem: layer_norm_ablation)
- **Degradation: +0.60%** when removing all RMSNorm
- **Training:** Stable at LR=3e-4 but higher initial loss (17.68 vs 9.26)
- **Conclusion:** RMSNorm improves stability and performance but not strictly required
- **Recommendation:** Use RMSNorm for better training dynamics

### 3. Pre-norm vs Post-norm (Problem: pre_norm_ablation)
- **Difference: -0.03%** (post-norm slightly better)
- **Conclusion:** Negligible difference at 4 layers
- **Recommendation:** Use pre-norm (community standard, scales better)

### 4. Position Embeddings (Problem: no_pos_emb)
- **Difference: +0.00%** (identical performance!)
- **Conclusion:** RoPE had zero measurable impact at 256 context length
- **Recommendation:** Use RoPE for longer contexts and length extrapolation

## Component Importance Ranking

1. **SwiGLU** - MODERATE IMPORTANCE (1.43% impact)
2. **RMSNorm** - LOW-MODERATE IMPORTANCE (0.60% impact)
3. **Pre-norm** - NEGLIGIBLE (0.03% impact)
4. **RoPE** - NEGLIGIBLE (0.00% impact)

## Surprising Results

### RoPE Had Zero Impact
Position embeddings made no measurable difference at 256 tokens. The model can learn positional relationships implicitly through:
- Causal masking structure
- Dataset statistics
- Learned attention patterns

### Post-norm Performed Better Than Pre-norm
While pre-norm is the standard, post-norm achieved slightly better validation loss (1.3897 vs 1.3902). At shallow depths (4 layers), the choice doesn't matter.

### No Layer Norm Trained Successfully
Despite common belief that layer norm is critical, the model trained stably at LR=3e-4 without any normalization. Performance degraded only 0.60%.

2. Check `ablation_comparison.png` for visual comparison
3. Use findings to write assignment submission
4. Consider additional experiments if needed:
   - Lower learning rates for no-layer-norm
   - Longer contexts for position embedding impact
   - Deeper models to test pre-norm benefits
